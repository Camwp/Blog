    "content": "Jellyfin is a fantastic open-source media server that allows you to stream your media to various clients without any paywalls or restrictions. Unlike its alternatives, Plex and Emby, Jellyfin is completely free-to-use, making it an excellent choice for Raspberry Pi enthusiasts.In this guide, we’ll show you how to set up Jellyfin on a Raspberry Pi and access it via its web interface.What is Jellyfin?Jellyfin is a media server that streams your media content from your Raspberry Pi to a variety of devices. It offers features like:  Inbuilt DVR and live TV functionality.  Support for major platforms such as Fire TV, Roku, Kodi, Android TV, iOS, and more.Jellyfin began as a fork of the Emby project after it became proprietary. While it doesn’t yet support as many client devices as Plex or Emby, it’s constantly improving.  Recommendation: Use a Raspberry Pi 4 for the best performance. While Jellyfin can run on a Raspberry Pi 3, heavy transcoding tasks may cause performance issues.Equipment You’ll NeedRecommended  Raspberry Pi 4 (or newer) Amazon  Micro SD Card (8GB+) Amazon  Ethernet Cable or Wi-Fi Adapter AmazonOptional  Raspberry Pi Case Amazon  USB Keyboard and Mouse AmazonPreparing Your Raspberry PiBefore installing Jellyfin, follow these steps to prepare your Raspberry Pi:1. Update Your Operating SystemRun the following commands to ensure your Raspberry Pi is up to date:sudo apt updatesudo apt upgrade -y2. Install Required PackagesInstall packages to support HTTPS repositories:sudo apt install apt-transport-https lsb-release3. Import the Jellyfin GPG KeyAdd the Jellyfin signing key:curl https://repo.jellyfin.org/debian/jellyfin_team.gpg.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/jellyfin-archive-keyring.gpg &gt;/dev/null4. Add the Jellyfin RepositoryAdd the Jellyfin repository to your Raspberry Pi:echo \"deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jellyfin-archive-keyring.gpg arch=$( dpkg --print-architecture )] https://repo.jellyfin.org/debian $( lsb_release -c -s ) main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jellyfin.list5. Update Package ListRefresh the package list to include the new repository:sudo apt update6. (Optional) Set a Static IP AddressTo make reconnecting to your Jellyfin server easier, consider setting a static IP address for your Raspberry Pi.Installing JellyfinWith the repository configured, installing Jellyfin is simple:1. Install JellyfinRun the following command:sudo apt install jellyfin2. Jellyfin SetupDuring installation:  A new user jellyfin is created to run the software.  A service is created to manage Jellyfin (it will start automatically on boot).Accessing the Jellyfin Web InterfaceOnce installed, access Jellyfin’s web interface:1. Find Your Raspberry Pi’s IP AddressRun the following command to get your IP address:hostname -I2. Open the Web InterfaceIn your web browser, navigate to:http://[IPADDRESS]:8096Replace [IPADDRESS] with the IP address from the previous step.Mounting an External Drive for JellyfinIf you want Jellyfin to access media from an external drive, follow these steps to mount the drive and set the appropriate permissions:1. Mount the External DriveFirst, ensure your external drive is connected to your Raspberry Pi. Find the drive’s mount point using:lsblkThen mount the drive (replace &lt;drive&gt; with your actual device name):sudo mount /dev/&lt;drive&gt; /media/&lt;default_user&gt;  “If your drive is already mounted automatically, you may skip this step as it will error.”2. Set Permissions for JellyfinAllow the jellyfin user to access the mounted drive:sudo setfacl -m u:jellyfin:rx /media/&lt;default_user&gt;Replace &lt;default_user&gt; with the actual username or path where the drive is mounted.3. Add Media to JellyfinIn the Jellyfin web interface, go to the Libraries section and add the path to your external drive as a media source.SummaryYou now have Jellyfin running on your Raspberry Pi! You can stream your media library to various devices and enjoy features like DVR and live TV, all for free. Explore Jellyfin’s settings to customize your experience further.For more Raspberry Pi projects, check out our blog.Happy streaming!"
